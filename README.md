<h1>Retroactive Location Tracking for Contact Tracing</h1>
People who contract coronavirus are often unaware of the places they have been, making it difficult to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html">"flatten the curve‚Äù</a>.

As of 3/29, there have been over 660,000 cases of people contracting the coronavirus (COVID-19).

For those who have tested postive for the coronavirus, tracking those in close and recent contact limits the spread of the virus. Contact tracing is a practice recomended by the <a href = "https://www.who.int/features/qa/contact-tracing/en/"> World Health Organization</a>.

This Jupyter notebook walks through how to download important data that will help you track where you were the past 30 days based on your past logins, helping with the recommended contact tracing.

<b>All data is not collected or stored in any way by the developers of this program. </b> Moreover, since we are using Selenium, you can view all the interactions that occurs within your browser.

All you need to do is to run every codeblock below to download the necessary data and visualize where you were the past 30 days!

Then you can download the data and share it with others if you want.
